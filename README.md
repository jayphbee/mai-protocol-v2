Mai Protocol V2 builds the decentralized Perpetual contracts on Ethereum.

The name Mai comes from two Chinese characters "买" which means buy and "卖" which means sell. Using pinyin (the modern system for transliterating Chinese characters to Latin letters) "买" is spelled Mǎi and "卖" is spelled Mài. Thus, "Mai" means "Buy" and "Sell".
